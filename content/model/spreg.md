description: "Spreg supports the estimation of classic and spatial regression models. Currently, it contains methods for estimating standard and spatial versions of models such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS), Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR), and Random and Fixed effects panels. Additionally, it offers various tests of homoskedasticity, normality, spatial randomness, and different types of spatial autocorrelation."
