PySAL Code of Conduct
=====================

Introduction
------------

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the PySAL project,
including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis,
blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our
community. The PySAL project does not organise in-person events, however
events related to our community should have a code of conduct similar in
spirit to this one.

This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in
the PySAL community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation
with the project, in any project-related activities and especially when
representing the project, in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common
understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please
try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a
friendly and productive environment that enriches the surrounding
community.

Specific Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We strive to:

#. Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer
   to use public methods of communication for project-related messages,
   unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for
   help or project-related support, too; not only is a public support
   request much more likely to result in an answer to a question, it
   also ensures that any inadvertent mistakes in answering are more
   easily detected and corrected.

#. Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to
   resolve conflict, and assume good intentions. We may all experience
   some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration
   to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel
   uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

#. Be collaborative. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn
   we will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the
   benefit of the project, we are willing to explain to others how it
   works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better. Any
   decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those
   consequences seriously when making decisions.

#. Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early
   avoids many problems later, so we encourage questions, although we
   may direct them to the appropriate forum. We will try hard to be
   responsive and helpful.

#. Be careful in the words that we choose. We are careful and respectful
   in our communication and we take responsibility for our own speech.
   Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. We
   will not accept harassment or other exclusionary behaviour, such as:

   -  Violent threats or language directed against another person.
   -  Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
   -  Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
   -  Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally
      identifying information ("doxing").
   -  Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or
      non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history, without
      the sender's consent.
   -  Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
   -  Unwelcome sexual attention.
   -  Excessive profanity. Please avoid swearwords; people differ greatly
      in their sensitivity to swearing.
   -  Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
      stop, then stop.
   -  Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.


Diversity Statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PySAL project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We
are committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of.
Although we may not always be able to accommodate each individual's
preferences, we try our best to treat everyone kindly.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we
welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly
honour diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity
or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype,
political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability, to the extent
that these do not conflict with this code of conduct.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, PySAL development is
conducted in English.

Standards for behaviour in the PySAL community are detailed in the Code
of Conduct above. Participants in our community should uphold these
standards in all their interactions and help others to do so as well
(see next section).


Reporting Guidelines
--------------------

We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start
at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We also recognize that
sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the
guidelines in this Code of Conduct. Please keep this in mind when
deciding on how to respond to a breach of this Code.

For clearly intentional breaches, report those to the Code of Conduct
committee (see below). For possibly unintentional breaches, you may
reply to the person and point out this code of conduct (either in public
or in private, whatever is most appropriate). If you would prefer not to
do that, please feel free to report to the Code of Conduct Committee
directly, or ask the Committee for advice, in confidence.

You can report issues to the PySAL Code of Conduct committee at
**pysal-conduct@googlegroups.com**\ [create group and add link] or
**pysal/CoC**\ [create group and add link]. Currently, the committee
consists of:

-  Stefanie Lumnitz

   -  stefanie.lumnitz@gmail.com

-  James Gaboardi

   -  jgaboardi@gmail.com

-  Serge Rey

   -  sergio.rey@ucr.edu


If your report involves any members of the committee, or if they feel
they have a conflict of interest in handling it, then they will recuse
themselves from considering your report. Alternatively, if for any
reason you feel uncomfortable making a report to the committee, then you
can also contact:

-  **Julia Kochinsky? Gina Helfrich?**


Incident reporting resolution & Code of Conduct enforcement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will investigate and respond to all complaints. The **PySAL Code of
Conduct Committee** will protect the identity of the reporter, and treat
the content of complaints as confidential (unless the reporter agrees
otherwise).

In case of severe and obvious breaches, e.g. personal threat or violent,
sexist or racist language, we will immediately disconnect the originator
from PySAL communication channels; please see the manual for details.

In cases not involving clear severe and obvious breaches of this code of
conduct, the process for acting on any received code of conduct
violation report will be:

#. acknowledge report is received
#. reasonable discussion/feedback
#. mediation (if feedback didn't help, and only if both reporter and
   reportee agree to this)
#. enforcement via transparent decision (see `Code of Conduct Reporting
   Manual`_) by the Code of Conduct Committee

The committee will respond to any report as soon as possible, and at
most within 72 hours.

How to follow up on a report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the manual followed by PySAL's Code of Conduct Committee. It's
used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent and fair.

Enforcing the Code of Conduct impacts our community today and for the
future. It's an action that we do not take lightly. When reviewing
enforcement measures, the Code of Conduct Committee will keep the
following values and guidelines in mind:

-  Act in a personal manner rather than impersonal. The Committee can
   engage the parties to understand the situation, while respecting the
   privacy and any necessary confidentiality of reporters. However,
   sometimes it is necessary to communicate with one or more individuals
   directly: the Committee's goal is to improve the health of our
   community rather than only produce a formal decision.
-  Emphasize empathy for individuals rather than judging behavior,
   avoiding binary labels of "good" and "bad/evil". Overt, clear-cut
   aggression and harassment exists and we will be address that firmly.
   But many scenarios that can prove challenging to resolve are those
   where normal disagreements devolve into unhelpful or harmful behavior
   from multiple parties. Understanding the full context and finding a
   path that re-engages all is hard, but ultimately the most productive
   for our community.
-  We understand that email is a difficult medium and can be isolating.
   Receiving criticism over email, without personal contact, can be
   particularly painful. This makes it especially important to keep an
   atmosphere of open-minded respect of the views of others. It also
   means that we must be transparent in our actions, and that we will do
   everything in our power to make sure that all our members are treated
   fairly and with sympathy.
-  Discrimination can be subtle and it can be unconscious. It can show
   itself as unfairness and hostility in otherwise ordinary
   interactions. We know that this does occur, and we will take care to
   look out for it. We would very much like to hear from you if you feel
   you have been treated unfairly, and we will use these procedures to
   make sure that your complaint is heard and addressed.
-  Help increase engagement in good discussion practice: try to identify
   where discussion may have broken down and provide actionable
   information, pointers and resources that can lead to positive change
   on these points.
-  Be mindful of the needs of new members: provide them with explicit
   support and consideration, with the aim of increasing participation
   from underrepresented groups in particular.
-  Individuals come from different cultural backgrounds and native
   languages. Try to identify any honest misunderstandings caused by a
   non-native speaker and help them understand the issue and what they
   can change to avoid causing offence. Complex discussion in a foreign
   language can be very intimidating, and we want to grow our diversity
   also across nationalities and cultures.

*Mediation*: voluntary, informal mediation is a tool at our disposal. In
contexts such as when two or more parties have all escalated to the
point of inappropriate behavior (something sadly common in human
conflict), it may be useful to facilitate a mediation process. This is
only an example: the Committee can consider mediation in any case,
mindful that the process is meant to be strictly voluntary and no party
can be pressured to participate. If the Committee suggests mediation, it
should:

-  Find a candidate who can serve as a mediator.
-  Obtain the agreement of the reporter(s). The reporter(s) have
   complete freedom to decline the mediation idea, or to propose an
   alternate mediator.
-  Obtain the agreement of the reported person(s).
-  Settle on the mediator: while parties can propose a different
   mediator than the suggested candidate, only if common agreement is
   reached on all terms can the process move forward.
-  Establish a timeline for mediation to complete, ideally within two
   weeks.

The mediator will engage with all the parties and seek a resolution that
is satisfactory to all. Upon completion, the mediator will provide a
report (vetted by all parties to the process) to the Committee, with
recommendations on further steps. The Committee will then evaluate these
results (whether satisfactory resolution was achieved or not) and decide
on any additional action deemed necessary.


How the committee will respond to reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the committee (or a committee member) receives a report, they will
first determine whether the report is about a clear and severe breach
(as defined below). If so, immediate action needs to be taken in
addition to the regular report handling process.

Clear and severe breach actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start
at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We will deal quickly with
clear and severe breaches like personal threats, violent, sexist or
racist language.

When a member of the Code of Conduct committee becomes aware of a clear
and severe breach, they will do the following:

-  Immediately disconnect the originator from all PySAL communication
   channels.
-  Reply to the reporter that their report has been received and that
   the originator has been disconnected.
-  In every case, the moderator should make a reasonable effort to
   contact the originator, and tell them specifically how their language
   or actions qualify as a "clear and severe breach". The moderator
   should also say that, if the originator believes this is unfair or
   they want to be reconnected to PySAL, they have the right to ask for
   a review, as below, by the Code of Conduct Committee. The moderator
   should copy this explanation to the Code of Conduct Committee.
-  The Code of Conduct Committee will formally review and sign off on
   all cases where this mechanism has been applied to make sure it is
   not being used to control ordinary heated disagreement.

Report handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a report is sent to the committee they will immediately reply to
the reporter to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 72
hours, and the group should strive to respond much quicker than that.

If a report doesn't contain enough information, the committee will
obtain all relevant data before acting. The committee is empowered to
act on the Steering Council’s behalf in contacting any individuals
involved to get a more complete account of events.

The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best
of their ability:

-  What happened.
-  Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
-  Who are the responsible party(ies).
-  Whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to
   anyone's physical safety.

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
group's deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. chat
transcripts, email discussions, recorded conference calls, summaries of
voice conversations, etc).

It is important to retain an archive of all activities of this committee
to ensure consistency in behavior and provide institutional memory for
the project. To assist in this, the default channel of discussion for
this committee will be a private mailing list accessible to current and
future members of the committee as well as members of the Steering
Council upon justified request. If the Committee finds the need to use
off-list communications (e.g. phone calls for early/rapid response), it
should in all cases summarize these back to the list so there's a good
record of the process.

The Code of Conduct Committee should aim to have a resolution agreed
upon within two weeks. In the event that a resolution can't be
determined in that time, the committee will respond to the reporter(s)
with an update and projected timeline for resolution.



Resolutions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the group
cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the group will
turn the matter over to the Steering Council for resolution.

Possible responses may include:

-  Taking no further action
-  if we determine no violations have occurred.
-  if the matter has been resolved publicly while the committee was
   considering responses.
-  Coordinating voluntary mediation: if all involved parties agree, the
   Committee may facilitate a mediation process as detailed above.
-  Remind publicly, and point out that some behavior/actions/language
   have been judged inappropriate and why in the current context, or can
   but hurtful to some people, requesting the community to self-adjust.
-  A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved.
   In this case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand to the
   individual(s) over email, cc'ing the group.
-  A public reprimand. In this case, the committee chair will deliver
   that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred, within
   the limits of practicality. E.g., the original mailing list for an
   email violation, but for a chat room discussion where the
   person/context may be gone, they can be reached by other means. The
   group may choose to publish this message elsewhere for documentation
   purposes.
-  A request for a public or private apology, assuming the reporter
   agrees to this idea: they may at their discretion refuse further
   contact with the violator. The chair will deliver this request. The
   committee may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to this request: for
   example, the group may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain
   one’s membership on a mailing list.
-  A "mutually agreed upon hiatus" where the committee asks the
   individual to temporarily refrain from community participation. If
   the individual chooses not to take a temporary break voluntarily, the
   committee may issue a "mandatory cooling off period".
-  A permanent or temporary ban from some or all PySAL spaces (mailing
   lists, gitter.im, etc.). The group will maintain records of all such
   bans so that they may be reviewed in the future or otherwise
   maintained.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the
committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected
parties and explain the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if
this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.

Finally, the committee will make a report to the PySAL Steering Council
(as well as the PySAL core team in the event of an ongoing resolution,
such as a ban).

The committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public
statements will be made by the chair of the Code of Conduct Committee.

Conflicts of Interest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the event of any conflict of interest, a committee member must
immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if
necessary.
